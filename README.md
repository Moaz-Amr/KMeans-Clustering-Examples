# KMeans Clustering Examples

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks showcasing the application of the KMeans clustering algorithm on different datasets. The examples cover basic implementation, using the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters, and evaluating clustering performance with metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.

## Notebooks

- `KMeans.ipynb`: Basic KMeans clustering on the Iris dataset.
- `KMeans-Breast-Cancer.ipynb`: KMeans clustering on the Breast Cancer dataset with the Elbow Method.
- `KMeans-Mall-Customers.ipynb`: KMeans clustering for customer segmentation on the Mall Customers dataset with the Elbow Method.
- `KMeans-Country-Data-Evaluation.ipynb`: KMeans clustering on country data with clustering evaluation metrics.

## Requirements

- Python
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy (for some examples)

## Datasets

The notebooks use the following datasets (assuming they are available or will be provided):
- Iris dataset (built-in with scikit-learn)
- Breast Cancer dataset (built-in with scikit-learn)
- `Mall_Customers.csv`
- `Country-data.csv.xls`
